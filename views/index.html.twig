                        <h2>Security Of Data</h2>
                        <p>The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission
                            over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use
                            commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its
                            absolute security.</p>

                        <h2>Service Providers</h2>
                        <p>We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service ("Service
                            Providers"), to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Service-related services or to
                            assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</p>
                        <p>These third parties have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our
                            behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>

                        <h3>Analytics</h3>
                        <p>We may use third-party Service Providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Service.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Google Analytics</strong></p>
                                <p>Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports
                                    website traffic. Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our
                                    Service. This data is shared with other Google services. Google may use the
                                    collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising
                                    network.</p>
                                <p>You can opt-out of having made your activity on the Service available to Google
                                    Analytics by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. The add-on
                                    prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) from
                                    sharing information with Google Analytics about visits activity.</p>
